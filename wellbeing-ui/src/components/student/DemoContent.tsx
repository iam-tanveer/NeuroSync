  biology: `Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. 
This process occurs in the chloroplasts, specifically using chlorophyll pigments. 
The overall equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2. 
The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes, while the Calvin cycle 
takes place in the stroma. Understanding photosynthesis is crucial for comprehending 
how energy flows through ecosystems and the fundamental basis of most life on Earth.`,

  math: `The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the 
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. Mathematically expressed 
as a² + b² = c², where c represents the hypotenuse. This theorem has numerous practical 
applications in construction, navigation, and computer graphics. To prove this theorem, 
we can use geometric manipulation or algebraic methods. It's important to note that this 
only applies to right triangles with a 90-degree angle.`,

  history: `The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization that took place 
during the late 1700s and early 1800s. It began in Britain and eventually spread throughout 
the world. This era saw the mechanization of agriculture and textile manufacturing, the 
development of iron-making techniques, and the increased use of steam power. The Industrial 
Revolution marked a major turning point in history, affecting almost every aspect of daily 
life and setting the stage for modern economic systems and urban societies.`,

  chemistry: `Chemical bonding occurs when atoms combine to form molecules. There are three 
main types: ionic bonding (transfer of electrons), covalent bonding (sharing of electrons), 
and metallic bonding (sea of delocalized electrons). Ionic bonds typically form between 
metals and non-metals, creating compounds like sodium chloride. Covalent bonds form between 
non-metals, creating molecules like water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Understanding 
chemical bonding is essential for predicting molecular properties and chemical reactions.`

  quantum: `Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at the molecular, 
atomic, nuclear, and even smaller microscopic levels. The fundamental concept of quantum 
theory is quantization, which means that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta 
rather than continuous waves. Wave-particle duality suggests that particles can exhibit 
properties of both waves and particles. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that 
we cannot simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle with absolute 
precision.`,

  economics: `Macroeconomic equilibrium occurs when aggregate demand equals aggregate supply 
at a specific price level. The AD-AS model illustrates the relationship between price level 
and real GDP. Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation to influence economic 
activity, while monetary policy uses interest rates and money supply. The multiplier effect 
amplifies the impact of government spending on GDP. Understanding these concepts is crucial 
for analyzing economic fluctuations and policy interventions.`,

  philosophy: `Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature, scope, and 
limits of human knowledge. It addresses fundamental questions: What is knowledge? How is 
knowledge acquired? What do people know? The traditional analysis of knowledge defines it 
as justified true belief. However, Gettier problems challenged this definition by presenting 
cases where justified true belief doesn't seem to constitute knowledge. Contemporary 
epistemologists continue to debate the precise definition and criteria for knowledge.`
